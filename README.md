# CARBAZOLE-BASED_DYES_LINEAR_MODELS
Suporting information to the work **DESIGN NEW CARBAZOLE-BASED DYES FOR DYE-SENSITIZED SOLAR CELL: A LINEAR MODELS APPROACH** submitted in this journal.

## Components
- A brief discussion of the molecular descriptors present in the best linear model (see the pdf 'Interpretation of Molecular Descriptors');
- Training and testing set used in the modeling (Train_Test_csv/Train_and_test_set.csv);
- Dyes' Molecular structure (SMILES and .out optimization/excited) and DSSCs' experimental PCE (see the 'structure_and_data' folder);
- Some R scripts used in modelling (see the 'R_scripts' folder).
